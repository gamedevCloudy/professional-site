            It gives me the possibility to persue a Masters in AI at some NIT,
            with my next attempt I could probably make it into IIT as well.
            <br />
            Although, I'm not that rigid on doing Masters. Mostly because I'd
            appriciate a job that compensates my rank.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is probably because I'm more comfortable doing a job. After
            having ran my own studio, having worked with talent across globe, I
            like work. It feels good to work.
          </p>

          <p>
            I don't like sitting in college classes. But masters is different,
            (in my assumption), you have to work on something real but then
            there are also my college professors compiling work of 5 different
            researches and getting a Ph.D. IITs or NITs must be different tho.
            <br />
            I do have regained the ability to dig through textbooks, I

          <b>Career Aspects</b>
        </summary>

        <p>
          Big tech does not need game devs. <br />
          I need big tech money.
          <br />
          I can always come back to gamedev later(if I approach it as a business
          again).
        </p>
        <p>
          You can say I do not wanna trade passion for corporate money.
          <br />
          But Aayush, aren't there passionate studios making games?
          <br />Yeah, but are they making money as well?<br /><br />
          (probably, and if they do, they either don't hire remote in
          India(assuming they are probably not it India.(Yeah my brackets have
          brackets)) and Indian ones will probably pay me around 8LPA max. No,
          sorry, can't do.)
        </p>
        <p>
          For now, I see gamedev as a fallback career. No offence to the
          passionate people. Its just my creative juices have ran out leeching
          to no progress made despite the consistent efforts.
        </p>
        <p>
          This statement probably means that I don't get a job at Lila games
          now. Which pay large btw.
        </p>
        <p>
          Idk, as graduation appraoches, this need of job is frustrating me.
          <br />
          As time passes by, I can bear this unstablity of having to choose
          between careers and when to go applying for a job.
        </p>
        <p>
          At my current situation, I may have picked quite a few skills that are
          not gamedev. I know I am a good developer.
          <br />
          But the job market does not care. They want highly skilled individuals
          with very specific skills or the leetcode/code chef girnder.
          <br />
          Okay, some passion may be left behind. I am making consistent effort
          towards studing ml. I do know Data Structures. But I do not like to
          grind only those competitive platforms.
          <br />
          <br />
          I understand that it indicates someone who can join in and pick up
          stuff as they go. But can't someone who's been doing gamedev for 4
          years do that?
          <br />
          I do have my copy of Cracking the Code Interview. I do plan on
          finishing it by August 2024. I'm not aginst it but don't make it the
          only benchmark.
          <br />
          As I read more about ML, I will be pretty good at it too. That's my
          nature, pickup something to study and go deep. Compete there.
