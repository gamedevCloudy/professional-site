          <h4>Hello, I'm Aayushüëãüèª</h4>
          <p>
            a programmer and hobbyist writer(not really). I grew up playing in
            Mustard feilds in Haryana.
          </p>

            I'm currently a student in Pune, studying AI and Data Science. I run
            a game studio part time, with two games published and many tested in
            collaboration with YSO Corp and Moonee. It's mostly not active as
            I'm exploring other experiences and focusing on learing.

            I will graduate in 2025 with BE. I've qualified GATE with 6918 All
            India Rank. Its a 4 digit rank but atleast there's a 69 in it. It
            gives me the possibility to persue a Masters in AI at some NIT, with
            my next attempt I could probably make it into IIT as well.

        <h4>Where do I see myself?</h4>
        <p>
          Although, I'm not that rigid on doing Masters. Mostly because I'd
          appriciate a job that compensates my rank. Simply put, anything that
          beats avg. package of my rank's college. (sits around 14 lpa)

          I know you must be thinking, huh why does this guy only care about
          money. IDK, after working hard enough for years, I don't wanna work
          for some small odd job or trying to meet esg goals. I care about what
          I get in return for the value I provide. Something like Netflix.
          They're clear about this, at the end of the day, the employee works
          for money.
